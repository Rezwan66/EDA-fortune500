# EDA-fortune500
An exploratory data analysis in SQL using data from Stack Overflow, Fortune 500 companies, and 311 help requests from Evanston, IL.

This is a project work using SQL of a data analysis course that I have completed from DataCamp named 'Exploratory Data Analysis in SQL'.

It is mainly comprised of:
- Analysis of numeric, character, and date/time data types.
- Using functions to aggregate, summarize, and analyze data without leaving the database.
- We also fixed common problems faced with the dataset and cleaned up the messy data.
